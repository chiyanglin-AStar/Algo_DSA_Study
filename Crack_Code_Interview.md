Interview Questions

1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?
Hints: #44, #117, #132
[Determine if a string has all Unique Characters](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/determine-string-unique-characters/)

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.
Hints: f t , #84, #122, #131
[Check if two strings are permutation of each other](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-strings-are-permutation-of-each-other/)

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr 3ohn Smith 13
Output: "Mr%203ohn%20Smith"
Hints: #53,0118

1.4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco e t a " , etc.)
Hints: #106, h 0134, § 136

1.5 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.
EXAMPLE
p a l e , pie -> true
p a l e s , pale -> true
p a l e , bale -> true
p a l e , bake -> false
Hints: #23, #97, it 130

1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3, If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
Hints: #92, if 110


1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
Hints: «51,0100

1.8 Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
Hints: #17, #74, #102

1.9 String Rotation; Assume you have a method i s S u b s t r i n g which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, si and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of si using only one
call to i s S u b s t r i n g [e.g., "water b o t t l e " is a rotation o P ' e r b o t t l e w a t " ) ,
Hints: #34, #88,#W4

Additional Questions: Object-Oriented Design (#7.12), Recursion (#8.3), Sorting and Searching (#10.9), C++
(#12.11), Moderate Problems (#16.8, #16.17, #16,22), Hard Problems (#17.4, #17.7, #17.13, #17.22, #17,26).
Hints start on page 653.
